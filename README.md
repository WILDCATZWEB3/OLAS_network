## Introduction

OLAS Network is a decentralized blockchain designed for secure and fast transactions with support for staking and smart contracts. It is built with **Python** and uses a **Proof of Work (PoW)** consensus mechanism. The blockchain is designed to promote the advertisement of Nigerian projects and includes features like staking, smart contract deployment, and transaction management.

## Blockchain Overview

OLAS Network operates by creating blocks that contain a list of transactions. The blockchain is secured through a **Proof of Work** system where miners solve computational puzzles to add blocks to the chain. Users can participate in staking, earn rewards, and deploy smart contracts on the blockchain.

### Core Features:
1. **Transactions:** Users can transfer tokens between accounts.
2. **Proof of Work (PoW):** Miners compete to solve computational puzzles and add blocks to the blockchain.
3. **Staking:** Users can stake their tokens and earn rewards.
4. **Smart Contracts:** Developers can deploy and execute smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Setting Up the Blockchain

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x installed.
- A terminal/command-line environment.

### Installation Steps:
